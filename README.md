# odin-lading-page
This is an exercise from The Odin Project where we need to build a landing page wich i'll use as a sandbox for me to apply new stuff that i'm learning.

But there is a concpet behind this simple landing-page. 

I had the ideia of building a "bridge" to get informed on the main racing championships because i love'em and i like to stay tuned so i found it would be a good oportunity to learn programming and building something useful for me (and others) at the same time! The landing-page will be as much informative as possible for those who doesn't know racing at all and at the same time will be a place where you'll be able to access websites to keep up with the championships or to just know what they are!
