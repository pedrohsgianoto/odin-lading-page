# odin-lading-page
This is an exercise from The Odin Project where we need to build a landing page wich i'll use as a sandbox for me to apply new stuff that i'm learning. But for a while i won't put any fancy styling or anything, i'll just finish the project in order to continue the course. For now there are imperfections like images and links moving the others when hover wich i'll fix sometime, i just wan't to proceed in the course for now since i've delivered what the "Project: Landing-Page" assignment asks.

Will this be a simple course assignment? Well, there is a concpet behind this landing-page that i will apply someday.

I had the ideia of building a "bridge" to get informed on the main racing championships because i love'em and i like to keep up with it so i found it would be a good oportunity to learn programming and building something useful for people that like racing at the same time! 

The landing-page will be as much informative as possible for those who doesn't know racing at all and at the same time will be a place where you'll be able to access websites to keep up with the championships or to just know what they are!
